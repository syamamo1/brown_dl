Model statistics:

batch_size = 100 - train time = 7s, average loss = 0.34, accuracy = 90.0%
Smaller batch sizes made train time increase, loss increase, and accuracy decrease. 
At around batch size = 50 the train time and loss stopped decreasing and accuracy stopped increasing. 

No known bugs or errors.
